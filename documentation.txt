Server - 
It contains function to decode the request into a form that can be analyesed by the deposit and withdraw functions.
    analyse_request(request)
    It does this by splitting the string into a list. TO ensure that the request is a valid one,
    it checks that the length of the list is two and that the first object is "Deposit" or "Withdraw" and the last 
    object is a number. It returns a message if it is not in the correct form.


It contains a deposit(money) function that accepts a number and adds it to the account balance and returns the current balance.
It contains a withdraw(money) function that accepts a number and subtracts it from the account balance and returns the current balance.
It contains a function that runs the whole function.
    -run_bank_server()
    This function declares the host and port. 
    It then creates a socket and binds the host and port to the socket.
    It listens for a client connection.
    When it finds one, it sends instructions on how the server works.
    It then listens for requests from the client. If the client enters "Close" as a request from the client,
    the server closes and so does the client.

Client 
It contains one function. The run_bank_client() function.
    - It declares the host and port. Makes a socket. Binds the socket to the host and port.
    - It then accepts the instructions from the server. After that, the user is able to use the client
    to send requests to the server. If the client sends "Close" the server and client closes.
